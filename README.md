- Auto-fills login forms to save time
- Syncs across devices (desktop/mobile)

## 💡 Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Never reuse passwords across sites

💡 Bitwarden has a built-in **password generator**:
> Tools → Password Generator → Choose length, types, etc.

## 🔐 Guidelines for Secure Password Storage and Sharing

- Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) on your password manager
- Don’t share passwords via email or text
- Use “sharing” features of Bitwarden (e.g., Organizations or Send)
- Use unique master password — never share your master password
- Regularly update important passwords

Using a password manager is the safest and most efficient way to:

✅ Generate strong passwords  
✅ Store them securely  
✅ Access them from anywhere  
✅ Share them safely (when needed)
